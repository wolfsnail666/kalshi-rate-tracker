## What is Kalshi Rate Tracker?

Kalshi Rate Tracker is a specialized monitoring tool for interest rate markets on Kalshi. It watches all FOMC, ECB, and BOE meeting outcome markets, tracks how Kalshi prices move in response to macro data (CPI, jobs, GDP), and compares Kalshi rate market pricing against CME Fed Funds futures to identify divergence opportunities.

Rate markets are the highest-volume category on Kalshi. This tool is built for them.

## How It Works

![kalshi rate tracker pipeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bc56983-afbd-4607-82f3-4c9d4f2c574e)

Three stages per monitoring cycle:

1. **Discover** - fetches all active Kalshi rate decision markets and updates meeting calendar
2. **Compare** - checks Kalshi implied probability against CME Fed Funds futures prices
3. **Alert** - sends notification when divergence exceeds threshold or after macro release

### Config Reference

```toml
[tracker]
monitor_interval_sec = 60
cme_divergence_threshold = 0.07

[markets]
track_fomc = true
track_ecb = true
track_boe = true
min_liquidity_usd = 1000

[alerts]
alert_on_macro_release = true
alert_on_cme_divergence = true
daily_summary_time = "08:00"

[kalshi]
api_key = ""
api_secret = ""

[telegram]

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is Kalshi Rate Tracker?**
Kalshi Rate Tracker monitors all interest rate decision markets on Kalshi - FOMC, ECB, and BOE - tracks how prices move around macro releases, and compares Kalshi implied probabilities against CME Fed Funds futures for divergence opportunities.

**What is CME divergence?**
When Kalshi's implied probability for a rate cut differs from CME Fed Funds futures implied probability by more than the threshold, it may indicate a mispricing between the two markets worth acting on.

**Does it execute trades?**
No. Rate Tracker is a monitoring and alert tool. It identifies divergence and macro price reactions but does not place orders. Pair with kalshi-alpha-finder for execution.

**How does it discover rate markets?**
It uses keyword matching on Kalshi market titles to automatically identify FOMC, ECB, and BOE meeting markets as they are created, without requiring manual configuration.

**What is the most useful alert?**
The CME divergence alert is the highest-signal notification. When Kalshi and CME diverge by 7%+ on the same meeting, one of them is mispriced relative to the other.

**Does it track historical rate market price evolution?**
Yes. Every monitoring cycle logs all rate market prices with timestamps, building a full price history per meeting for backtesting and analysis.
